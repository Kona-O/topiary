This directory holds an internally consistent set of phylogenetic analyses on
a small dataset to test the pipeline.

The model.txt file holds the phylogenetic model used for all of these
calculations.

Directories are complete input/outputs from the pipeline. These can be
regenerated using alignment-to-ancestors.ipynb.
