output: confusingly, this is the input for this calculation. It's an "output" 
        directory from a previous ml_bootstrap run. This contains an extra
        "species_tree.newick" file I put in here for convenience. 
generax-bs-replicates_pre-run: bootstrap replicate directories, pre generax
generax-bs-replicates_post-run: bootstrap replicate directories, post generax
expected-output: final output we expect in "output" directory
